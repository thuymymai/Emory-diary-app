*Android application that creates balance in your life!*

Emory is a friend whom you can confide in, rely on and accompany. Whether you are happy, sad or confused, it will be there to “listen” to your stories and help to organize your life.

## How Emory works?

Step 1: You must always sign in to use the app. It is for confidential purposes. If you did not have an account, please sign up.

Step 2: You can select Mood for any day you want, add Actions related to your Mood, spill your mind in the Note and add a memorable picture representing your day. 

Step 3: All the Diary items you made are saved according to day and month. You can look back at all the memories you created.

Step 4: Look out at the Mood Graph, where your mood fluctuation is displayed. Don’t let the graph go down!

Step 5: If you have a list of things to do, TodoList will be there to help. Add tasks, deadlines and things you might forget to the list. Turn on reminder and you are on schedule!
